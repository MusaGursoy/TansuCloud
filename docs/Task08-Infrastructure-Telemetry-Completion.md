# Task 08: Infrastructure Telemetry Implementation - Completion Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Overview

Extended Task 08 (OTEL baseline across services) to include **infrastructure telemetry** for PostgreSQL, PgCat, and Redis, achieving unified observability across all application and infrastructure services.

## Objective

Enable all infrastructure services to report metrics to the OTLP collector alongside the 5 application services (Gateway, Identity, Dashboard, Database, Storage), providing:

- Unified observability in SigNoz
- Correlation between application traces and infrastructure metrics
- Proactive alerting on infrastructure anomalies
- Faster incident triage and root cause analysis

## Implementation Summary

### 1. PostgreSQL Telemetry

**Exporter**: `postgres-exporter` (quay.io/prometheuscommunity/postgres-exporter:latest)

**Configuration**:
```yaml
postgres-exporter:
  image: quay.io/prometheuscommunity/postgres-exporter:latest
  container_name: tansu-postgres-exporter
  ports:
    - "9187:9187"
  environment:
    DATA_SOURCE_NAME: "postgresql://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable"
  networks:
    - tansu-net
  depends_on:
    - postgres
```

**Key Metrics**:
- Connection pool statistics
- Query performance (execution time, query counts)
- Table and index sizes
- Replication lag
- Transaction rates
- Cache hit ratios
- Lock waits and deadlocks

**Metrics Endpoint**: `http://127.0.0.1:9187/metrics`

### 2. Redis Telemetry

**Exporter**: `redis-exporter` (oliver006/redis_exporter:latest)

**Configuration**:
```yaml
redis-exporter:
  image: oliver006/redis_exporter:latest
  container_name: tansu-redis-exporter
  ports:
    - "9121:9121"
  environment:
    REDIS_ADDR: "redis:6379"
  networks:
    - tansu-net
  depends_on:
    - redis
```

**Key Metrics**:
- Memory usage and fragmentation
- Eviction counts
- Command latency (per command type)
- Keyspace statistics
- Replication lag
- Hit/miss ratios
- Connected clients

**Metrics Endpoint**: `http://127.0.0.1:9121/metrics`

### 3. PgCat Telemetry

**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Reason**: PgCat does not have a standard Prometheus exporter. The admin interface (port 9930) uses a custom protocol and would require significant custom development to expose Prometheus-compatible metrics. This is out of scope for Task 08.

**Future Options**:
- Build a custom PgCat Prometheus exporter
- Use PgCat's admin API with a custom scraper
- Wait for upstream PgCat project to add native Prometheus support

### 4. OTEL Collector Configuration

**Updated**: `dev/signoz-otel-collector-config.yaml`

**Added Scrape Jobs**:
```yaml
receivers:
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        # Existing application metrics...
        
        - job_name: 'postgres'
          scrape_interval: 30s
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['postgres-exporter:9187']
              labels:
                service: 'postgres'
                environment: 'development'
        
        - job_name: 'redis'
          scrape_interval: 15s
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['redis-exporter:9121']
              labels:
                service: 'redis'
                environment: 'development'
```

**Note**: PgCat scrape job was removed as no standard Prometheus exporter exists for PgCat.

**Metrics Flow**:
```
Infrastructure Service → Prometheus Exporter → OTLP Collector (Prometheus Receiver) 
  → Batch Processor → OTLP Exporter → SigNoz → ClickHouse
```

### 5. Telemetry Service Production Resilience

**Problem**: [`TansuCloud.Telemetry`](TansuCloud.Telemetry ) ingests logs from other services. If it also tries to send its own telemetry to SigNoz, and SigNoz is unavailable, this could create operational issues or circular dependencies.

**Solution**: Added ability to disable OTLP export for the Telemetry service in production while keeping it enabled for other services.

**Configuration Added**:
```json
// TansuCloud.Telemetry/appsettings.json (production)
{
  "OpenTelemetry": {
    "Otlp": {
      "Enabled": false,  // Disable OTLP export to avoid circular dependencies
      "Endpoint": "http://signoz-otel-collector:4317"
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Telemetry service continues accepting and storing logs even if SigNoz is down
- No circular dependencies (Telemetry → SigNoz → Telemetry)
- Graceful degradation in production
- Can be re-enabled via environment variable if needed: `OpenTelemetry__Otlp__Enabled=true`

**Implementation Details**:
- Updated `OpenTelemetryExtensions.AddTansuOtlpExporter()` to respect `Enabled` flag
- Existing retry/backoff logic preserved for services that do export to OTLP
- Default remains `true` for all services except Telemetry in production

## Files Modified

1. **`docker-compose.yml`** - Added 2 exporter services (PostgreSQL, Redis) for dev environment
2. **`docker-compose.prod.yml`** - Added 2 exporter services with production hardening
3. **`dev/signoz-otel-collector-config.yaml`** - Added Prometheus scrape jobs for PostgreSQL and Redis; removed PgCat
4. **`TansuCloud.Telemetry/appsettings.json`** - Added `OpenTelemetry:Otlp:Enabled=false` for production resilience
5. **`TansuCloud.Telemetry/appsettings.Development.json`** - Added `OpenTelemetry:Otlp:Enabled=true` for dev
6. **`TansuCloud.Observability.Shared/OpenTelemetryExtensions.cs`** - Updated to respect `Enabled` flag
7. **`Tasks-M1.md`** - Updated Task 08 status to Completed with detailed notes

## Verification Steps

### Quick Verification

```powershell
# 1. Start the stack
docker compose up -d

# 2. Wait for services to be healthy
Start-Sleep -Seconds 60

# 3. Verify exporters are running
docker ps | grep exporter

# 4. Check metrics endpoints
curl http://127.0.0.1:9187/metrics  # PostgreSQL
curl http://127.0.0.1:9188/metrics  # PgCat
curl http://127.0.0.1:9121/metrics  # Redis

# 5. Check collector logs for successful scrapes
docker logs signoz-otel-collector | Select-String "postgres|pgcat|redis"

# 6. Open SigNoz UI
Start-Process http://127.0.0.1:3301/

# 7. Run health E2E tests
dotnet test --filter HealthEndpointsE2E
```

### Expected Results

- ✅ 2 exporter containers running (`tansu-postgres-exporter`, `tansu-redis-exporter`)
- ✅ Each exporter responds with Prometheus-formatted metrics on its respective port
- ✅ Collector logs show successful scrapes for both jobs (postgres, redis)
- ✅ SigNoz UI displays infrastructure metrics in Metrics Explorer (postgres and redis metrics visible)
- ✅ Health E2E tests pass (10/10)
- ✅ Telemetry service continues operating even if OTLP export is disabled or SigNoz is unavailable

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Unified Observability
- **Single source of truth**: All metrics (application + infrastructure) in SigNoz
- **Eliminates tool sprawl**: No need for separate PostgreSQL monitoring, Redis monitoring, etc.
- **Consistent UX**: Same query language, dashboards, and alerting for all metrics

### 2. Correlation and Context
- **Trace to infrastructure**: Link slow application spans to DB query performance
- **End-to-end visibility**: See the full request path from Gateway → App → DB → Cache
- **Faster triage**: Identify whether issues originate from app logic or infrastructure

### 3. Proactive Monitoring
- **Infrastructure alerts**: Trigger on connection pool saturation, memory pressure, replication lag
- **Capacity planning**: Track resource consumption trends to predict scaling needs
- **Cost optimization**: Identify over-provisioned or under-utilized infrastructure

### 4. Developer Experience
- **No manual instrumentation**: Infrastructure metrics come "for free" via exporters
- **Standardized approach**: Same OTLP/Prometheus pattern for all services
- **Local dev parity**: Dev environment mirrors production observability setup

## Production Hardening Checklist

- [ ] **Pin exporter image versions** (e.g., `postgres-exporter:v0.15.0` instead of `:latest`)
- [ ] **Configure resource limits** on exporter containers (memory/CPU)
- [ ] **Secure exporter endpoints** (keep internal-only, no public exposure)
- [ ] **Use read-only credentials** for PostgreSQL exporter
- [ ] **Adjust scrape intervals** (60s or 120s for large deployments)
- [ ] **Set up SigNoz alerts** for critical thresholds (see recommended alerts below)
- [ ] **Enable authentication** for PgCat admin interface if exposed
- [ ] **Configure retention policies** in SigNoz for infrastructure metrics
- [ ] **Test failover scenarios** (exporter failure, collector restart)
- [ ] **Document runbooks** for infrastructure alert responses
- [x] **Disable OTLP export for Telemetry service in production** (set `OpenTelemetry:Otlp:Enabled=false` to avoid circular dependencies)

## TansuCloud.Telemetry OTLP Configuration

The TansuCloud.Telemetry service has special handling for OTLP export to prevent circular dependencies and ensure graceful operation when SigNoz is unavailable:

### Production Configuration (appsettings.json)

```json
{
  "OpenTelemetry": {
    "Otlp": {
      "Enabled": false,
      "Endpoint": "",
      "Comments": "OTLP export is disabled in production for the Telemetry service to avoid circular dependencies and ensure self-contained operation. The service continues to function normally without SigNoz connectivity."
    }
  }
}
```

### Behavior

- **When `Enabled: false`**: OTLP exporters are not added to the telemetry pipeline. The service continues to function normally, collecting and storing telemetry data locally without attempting to export to SigNoz.
- **When `Enabled: true` or omitted**: OTLP exporters are added with full retry logic (5 attempts, exponential backoff 1s → 16s). The service remains operational even if SigNoz is unreachable; telemetry data is buffered and retried automatically.
- **Timeout handling**: 10s in Development, 30s in Production. Failed exports do not block the service.
- **Graceful degradation**: All OTLP export failures are logged but do not affect the service's core functionality (ingesting and storing telemetry from other services).

### Why Disable in Production?

1. **Avoid circular dependencies**: Telemetry service receives logs from all other services. If it also reports to SigNoz (which may have issues), this creates a potential circular dependency.
2. **Self-contained operation**: Telemetry service should be the "last resort" for observability data and should not depend on external systems.
3. **Simplify troubleshooting**: When SigNoz is down, the Telemetry service remains fully functional without retry noise in logs.

### Development Configuration

In development (`appsettings.Development.json`), OTLP export can be enabled for testing purposes by omitting the `Enabled: false` flag or explicitly setting `Enabled: true`.

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

These are **outside Task 08 scope** but could be valuable follow-ups:

1. **ClickHouse metrics** - Monitor SigNoz's storage backend (disk usage, query performance)
2. **Node Exporter** - Add host-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network)
3. **Pre-built SigNoz dashboards** - Create infrastructure dashboard templates
4. **Grafana integration** - Optional alternative visualization for teams preferring dashboard-as-code
5. **Custom PgCat exporter** - Build a dedicated exporter for richer PgCat metrics
6. **Alert templates** - Package recommended alerts as importable JSON
7. **Automated remediation** - Trigger auto-scaling or service restarts based on alerts
