# Development Principles: Specifications

Specifications are structured artifacts that transform high‑level ideas into actionable implementation plans with clarity, accountability, and traceability.

## Why Use Specifications

- ✔ Break down requirements into user stories with acceptance criteria
- ✔ Document system architecture and interactions
- ✔ Translate requirements into discrete, trackable tasks
- ✔ Maintain alignment between product vision and engineering execution

## Core Specification Files

### 1) Requirements.md

- Captures user stories and acceptance criteria using EARS notation.
- EARS format:

  WHEN [condition/event] → THE SYSTEM SHALL [expected behavior]

- Benefits: clarity, testability, traceability, completeness
- Organization: grouped by feature/service sections as necessary

### 2) Architecture.md

- Documents technical architecture, sequence diagrams, and design considerations
- Shows system components and their interactions
- Provides a reviewable blueprint for implementation decisions

### 3) Tasks.md

- Lists discrete, trackable tasks with descriptions, outcomes, and dependencies
- Serves as the execution plan with real‑time status tracking
- Tasks follow logical order (e.g., baseline authentication before advanced flows)
- Emphasizes interdependency: features affect each other

## Workflow

1) Requirements Phase : Define user stories and acceptance criteria (EARS format)
2) Architecture Phase : Document system components, diagrams, and technical considerations
3) Implementation Planning : Break down into sequenced tasks with clear ownership
4) Execution Phase :Track progress, update tasks, and refine specs iteratively

## Guiding Principles

- Systematic Transformation: Vague ideas → testable requirements
- Alignment: Shared understanding between product and engineering
- Progressive Elaboration: Build incrementally, verify early
- Accountability: Every requirement, decision, and task is traceable
- Adaptability: Specs evolve but remain structured
